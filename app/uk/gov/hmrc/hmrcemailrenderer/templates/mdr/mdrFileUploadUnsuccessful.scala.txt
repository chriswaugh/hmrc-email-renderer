There is a problem with your file for MDR

Dear @{params("contactName")}

There is a problem with the file you tried to send at @{params("dateAndTime")} for the Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR) service.

You must send another version. Late reports may result in a penalty.

You can check any errors or problems in the MDR service and upload an updated XML file.

For reference, the File ID (MessageRefId) is: @{params("messageRefId")}

For security reasons, we have not included a link to the MDR service in this email.

If you need help
Email aeoi.enquiries@@hmrc.gov.uk for help with this service.

For more information on MDR, you can visit GOV.UK and search for ‘Mandatory Disclosure Rules’.
